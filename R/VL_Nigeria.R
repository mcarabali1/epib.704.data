#'
#'@description
#' This data is from a publicly available 'open data' set from a peer reviewed manuscript. The study is part of the Reaching Impact Saturation and Epidemic Control (RISE) project in Nigeria, and analyzes factors affecting viral re-suppression post-Enhanced Adherence Counseling (EAC). The data is from a retrospective analysis of a de-identified client-level dataset of unsuppressed viral load (VL) clients who were current on treatment at the end of June 2022 and subsequently enrolled in the EAC program.
